                <p>
                    <strong>King Charles III is famous for his support of environmental and social causes over the
                        years, but did you know he played a decisive role in the renaissance of traditional artisan
                        cheese in the UK?</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is a perfect example of the way he has used his position to help support the issues he cares
                    about.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It may also hint at what a modern Carolean monarchy could look like.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The story begins back in the early 1990s when a series of food scares had shaken confidence in
                    British food.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A raft of new hygiene rules designed for industrial cheesemakers was being applied to dairies
                    producing farmhouse cheeses - including a potential ban on the use of unpasteurised milk.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Across the country artisan cheesemakers were teetering on the edge of bankruptcy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Randolph Hodgson was worried, as he had spent the previous decade attempting to revive British
                    cheesemaking by promoting the best produce through his cheese shop in London's Covent Garden,
                    Neal's Yard Dairy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "I really believed it would be the end of the great tradition of cheesemaking in the UK once and
                    for all," he says.

                    <strong>The Kremlin has admitted mistakes were made in its drive to mobilise Russian army
                        reservists to fight in Ukraine, amid growing public opposition</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    "There are cases when the decree is violated," Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesman
                    said, adding that "all the errors will be corrected".
                </p>
                <p>
                    Multiple reports say people with no military experience - or who are too old or disabled - are
                    being called up.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Last week's mobilisation decree has already triggered widespread protests.
                </p>
                <p>
                    President Putin announced what he described as partial mobilisation on 21 September, with
                    Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu later saying 300,000 reservists would be called up.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, reports in opposition Russian media suggested that up to one million people could be
                    called up, pointing out that one paragraph believed to be about the exact number of the required
                    reservists was omitted (classified) in the published version of Mr Putin's decree on the
                    official Kremlin website.

                    <strong>Former US intelligence contractor Edward Snowden, who leaked extensive US intelligence
                        surveillance operations, has been granted Russian citizenship.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The decree was signed by Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mr Snowden, 39, has been living in exile in Russia since exposing the National Security Agency
                    (NSA) programme affecting millions of Americans in 2013.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mr Snowden, who faces espionage charges in the US, has made no public comments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2020, the NSA surveillance of millions of Americans' telephone records was ruled unlawful by
                    the US Court of Appeals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mr Snowden said afterwards that he felt vindicated by the ruling.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Top US intelligence officials had publicly insisted the NSA had never knowingly collected data
                    from private phone records, until Mr Snowden exposed evidence to the contrary.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Following the revelation, officials said the NSA's surveillance program had played a crucial
                    role in fighting domestic terrorism, including the convictions of Basaaly Saeed Moalin, Ahmed
                    Nasir Taalil Mohamud, Mohamed Mohamud, and Issa Doreh, of San Diego, for providing aid to
                    al-Shabab militants in Somalia.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mr Snowden's lawyer Anatoliy Kucherena was on Monday quoted by Russian state-run news agencies
                    as saying that his client has never served in the Russian army, and therefore would not be
                    called up as part of a partial mobilisation announced by President Putin last week.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Russian authorities say they want to enlist 300,000 army reservists to fight in Ukraine,
                    amid growing public opposition.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Reports in opposition Russian media suggest that up to one million people could be called up.
